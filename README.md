JobPortal App is my Final Year Project (FYP), built using React Native and Firebase, designed to connect job seekers with employers.

The app allows users to browse job listings, apply for jobs, and manage their profiles. Employers can post job openings and manage applications. It features real-time database updates, user authentication, and clean mobile UI.

Technologies used:

🛠️ React Native for cross-platform mobile development

🔥 Firebase Authentication for login/signup

📦 Cloud Firestore for data storage

📷 Firebase Storage (optional) for uploading resumes or company logos# FYP-Mobile-App
